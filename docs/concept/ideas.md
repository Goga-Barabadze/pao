# Ideas

## Have a page to educate people about the different forms of biases and fallacies. Illustrated, simply explained, sorted by relevance and all on one page (Mental shortcuts)

## Have a page about blind spots one might have in the fields of interest. But also blind spots on topics one hasn't explored yet, sorted by importance

## Describe the website as strictly anti-sensational, dry, cold. Its excitement comes from the fact that it is like that, because it can be seen nowhere else

## A dedicated section for "invalid" arguments on every page. So people know that they shouldn't submit those

## Cooperate with social media sites to embed our content for a fee

## Bot detection (Scraping Vermeidung, Bot Farms, ChatGPT Bots): Anonym lesen, Schreiben nur wenn man einen Account seit 21 Tagen hat, und die Rating Accuracy mit anderen Bots zu mindestens 80% Ã¼bereinstimmt, Every 12 hours, re-check the sources and ratings and warn all users with a match-rating below 80% and block the ones lower than 70%. For scraping: randomize class names of styles. Offer a cheap API as an alternative which just covers the costs
