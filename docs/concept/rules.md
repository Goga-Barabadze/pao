## 1. Argue for What You Think To Be True

> When you are studying any matter, or considering any philosophy, ask yourself only: "What are the facts, and what is the truth that the facts bear out?" Never let yourself be diverted , either by what you wish to believe, or by what you think could have beneficial social effects, if it were to be believed. But look only and solely at: "What are the facts?"
> **Bertrand Russell**
