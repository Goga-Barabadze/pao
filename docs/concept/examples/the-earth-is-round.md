# The Earth Is Round

## Definitions

- `The Earth`: the planet we live on
- `Round`: being such that every part of the surface or the circumference is equidistant from the center

## Claims

### The Earth Is Roughly An Oblate Spheroid

#### Definitions

- `Roughly`: unevenly; harshly; rudely; severely; austerely.
- `Oblate Spheroid`: a sphere squashed from the top so the circumference around the poles is less than the circumference around the equator.

#### Explanation

I used the word "roughly" because we could play the "I have a more precise definition"-game infinetly and would at some point be listing the exact atoms of the earth. I think the proposed claim should suffice for most circumstances.
