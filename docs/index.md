# An Introduction

The world we live in is impossibly complicated. Nobody can be expected to _truly_ understand any discipline wholy, even if we had a hundred years longer to live - let alone to understand the whole world, with all its nuances.

One would need to read thousands if not tens of thousands of scientific papers, websites and books to be able to summarize what the scientific consensus is on any given topic.

This inability and its decision paralysis has caused many to go the other route: trusting the truths which _seem_ right.
